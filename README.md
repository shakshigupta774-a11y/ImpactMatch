ImpactMatch-Frictionless Volunteer Platform
ImpactMatch is a one-click platform that connects volunteers with NGOs — no long forms, no repeated CV uploads. Volunteers discover opportunities instantly, and NGOs (even new ones) can recruit easily.

🌍 Problem  
Volunteers often abandon opportunities because of:  
- Long forms & CV uploads  
- Scattered, hard-to-find NGOs  
- Small NGOs lacking recruitment tools  

This results in lost high-intent volunteers + NGOs struggling to scale.
